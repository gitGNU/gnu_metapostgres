MetaPostgres is a set of set of MetaPost macros to depict internals of
PostgreSQL database server.

If you want to use it, please make sure you have both MetaPost language
and TeX typesetting system --- see http://www.tug.org/ for information on both
if you're not familiar with them.

TeX is used only to typeset labels, so the plain TeX is sufficient. In
practice, if you download MetaPost from your OS repository (typically in the
RPM format), you'll probably find out that MetaPost depends on TeX, so TeX
gets installed automatically too.

The simplest use looks like:

cd examples
mpost -s 'outputformat="svg"' -s 'outputtemplate="%j.svg"' -mem=internalvars \
-s 'finalscale=100' plan_tree_01.mp
